The virtual machine (or *dyno* in Heroku) for the free-tier sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity. If you are waking it up, you may encounter some problems. Simply reload the web page if you see any error (e.g. application error; file not found error). It should work eventually. The page may take a minute or two to come up.
